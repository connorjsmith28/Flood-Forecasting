Look into larger batching mateo, since I had some issues with frequent small batches getting me cutoff. 
Building the sample dataset could be better. I only pull a sub sample of sites, but all of the streamdata for it. Those dates also don't align 
with the force times which makes the combined datasite a subset of all 3 which is not ideal. 

Columns missing compared to CAMELSH:
    * Specific Humidity
