Decomission some of the extract pieces that don't exist anymore. 

Gages, HydroATLAS, and NDLS-2 contain attribute data that doesn't need to be streamed. Only water levels and weather do. 

I have pulled the attributes from CAMELSH, and now we have USGS water levels and Mateo weather extractors. 

Figure out how to get weather working.
