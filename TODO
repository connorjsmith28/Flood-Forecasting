Look into larger batching mateo, since I had some issues with frequent small batches getting me cutoff.

DONE: Integrate daily USGS streamflow into dbt final tables
    * raw.streamflow_daily now extracted alongside raw.streamflow_15min
    * Added stg_streamflow_daily staging model
    * Added fct_streamflow_daily mart model (daily weather aggregation)
    * Added flood_model_daily for sites with only daily data (1-day ahead targets)
    * Site coverage expanded from ~1,300 (IV only) to ~2,700 (IV + daily)

Columns missing compared to CAMELSH:
    * Specific Humidity
